## Surface Drinking Water
# The Colorado River (Upper and Lower HUCs)

- HUC = Hydorlogic Unit Code
  - Each HUC is about 35 square miles. 



# SHORT TERM IMPACT 

# Forest
- based on land cover and ownership of the forest
- important in protecting the surface water level importance.
- mains errosion (which can affect the nutrient cycle)
- protects against polluting waterways

Data is parsed by private, public and National Forest sections

# Fire 
- increases nitrogen, phosphorus, mecury and dissolved salts. 
- risidue from fire supressants


# Insect and Disease 
- invasive species attack trees faster since their are no natural preditors 
- leading to forest overcowarding (which is now a greatest risk than fire)
- alters forest structures and function


# LONG TERM IMPACT

# Development
- chronic water pollution from housing developments
- permenant forest loss



The index of importance surface level drinking water is evaluated by Highly threatened, highly Forested and importance.
