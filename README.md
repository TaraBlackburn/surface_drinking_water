## Surface Drinking Water
# The Long Term Impact that Developments Imply

- HUC = Hydorlogic Unit Code
  - Unique indentifier code for that region/subregion   
  - Each HUC is about 35 square miles. 


# Forest
- based on land cover and ownership of the forest
- important in protecting the surface water level importance.
- mains errosion (which can affect the nutrient cycle)
- protects against polluting waterways


# LONG TERM IMPACT

# Development
- chronic water pollution from housing developments
- permenant forest loss
- This is the most severe beacuse it 


## Hypothesis Testing
Hn: The population does not affect the level of threat of development to forests where two tails are 5% each
Ha: The population does affect the level of threat of development to forest

50,930 - how many sub regions have a surface water level importance (swli) above 0

42,432 - how many of those sub regions (w/ swli) are affected by development 

4,512 - how many of those sub regions (w/ swli and is affected by development) serve a population total 

4,372 - how many of those sub region's forests to swli are highly threatened by developments. 



# SHORT TERM IMPACT 

# Fire 
- increases nitrogen, phosphorus, mecury and dissolved salts. 
- residue from fire supressants


# Insect and Disease 
- invasive species attack trees faster since their are no natural preditors 
- leading to forest overcowarding (which is now a greatest risk than fire)
- alters forest structures and function

# DATA Cleaning

I ensured that the data points that I used were not rated at zero to screw the mean values.
